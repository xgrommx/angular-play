Angular Play Starter Project
============================

This project is a Play 2.1 Version of the [Angular Seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) project. The key features of this project are:

* Base Play Framework 2.1 Scala Project
* Use of WebJars for Dependency Management, including AngularJS & Twitter Bootstrap
* Sample code based on the [Angular Seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) project. Changes limited to `app/index.html` where reference to AngularJS script uses WebJar version.
* Latest versions of WebJar AngularJS (1.1.5) and Bootstrap Libraries (2.3.2)

This project does not depend on Require.JS as is the case with the official [Angular Seed Play](https://github.com/typesafehub/angular-seed-play) project.

Currently there is no Test Framework in place.
